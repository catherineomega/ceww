Introduction
============

Our database will build on data gathered from the 1980s through the
present for an existing database held at `Simon Fraser University`_,
`Canada’s Early Women Writers`_ which contains extensive
bio-bibliographic data on 471 selected authors. The new, expanded
database will include names of all the authors, with additional
information as known about life dates, geographical location, and
production.

The database backend is `MySQL`_, although other backends are
possible with minimal porting.

The front end is written in `Symfony`_ and `PHP`_ 5.5+ and uses Twitter
`Bootstrap`_ as the CSS framework. Twitter's `Typeahead`_ library is used in
a few spots, along with `jQuery`_.
